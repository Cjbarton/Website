   <h2>Why Do I Question this? </h2>
      <section>
         <p>Recently, the entire province of B.C. has to practice <em>Social Distance</em> due to a World Health Pandemic of a contagious virus known as Covid-19.

           How does that affect me?

           Wellâ€¦ I am a student participating in a Foundations in Innovations & Technology Program which was being delivered community-based (not on a regular school campus in a community we reside an hour away from).
           I am also a mother of 2 children under the age of 5, and expecting a 3rd child in early June.
         </p>

         <p>I was not prepared to relocate back home, and figure out how to be a focused student and give the best care to my children at the same time...</p>

    <h1> Here are changes that have happened with Social Distancing:
 </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> our classes had to adjust from in-class face-to-face delivery to online-based.</li>
      <li> <em> No gathering with anyone you do not live with. </em> </li>
      <li> <strong> No School/Childcare for my kids to attend.</strong> </li>
      <li>No going out to do social activities(playgrounds, recreational sports, visiting friends & family) </li>
      <li>Only going to shop for what you need (Food, medical prescriptions), getting medical attention if absolutely needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It has been a big adjustment. I felt that it would be impossible to balance being both a primary caregiver and a flourishing student. I wanted to give up because I really thought it would be too much for me.
However, self-defeat is always a challenge that I face, that I do not want my kids to learn from me.
 A commitment I made to myself is I would see myself through this program no matter what it takes.</p>
