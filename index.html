   <h2>Why Do I Question this? </h2>
      <section>
         <p>Recently the entire province of B.C. has to practice <em>Social Distance</em> due to a World Health Pandemic of a    virus known as Covid-19.

           How does that affect me?

           Wellâ€¦ I am a student participating in a Foundations in an Innovations & Technology Program which was being delivered community-based-- not on a regular school campus in a community we reside an hour away from.
           I am also a mother of 2 children under the age of 5, and expecting a 3rd child in early June.
         </p>

         <p>Once the pandemic became serious social distancing practices limited my normal every life.</p>

    <h1> Here are changes that have happened with Social Distancing:
 </h1>
    <ul>
      <li> our classes had to adjust from in-class face-to-face delivery to online-based.</li>
      <li> <em> No gathering with anyone you do not live with. </em> </li>
      <li> <strong> No school/Childcare for my kids to attend.</strong> </li>
      <li>No going out to do social activities(playgrounds, recreational sports, visiting friends & family) </li>
      <li>Only going to shop for what you need (Food, medical prescriptions), getting medical attention if absolutely needed.</li>
      <li> </li>
    </ul>
