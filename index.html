   <h2>Believing in myself and my kids to do our best each day</h2>
      <section>
         <p>Recently the entire province of B.C. has to practice <stong>“Social Distance” due to a World Health Pandemic of a virus known as Covid-19</strong>.
How does that affect me?
Well… I am a student participating in a Foundations in an Innovations & Technology Program which was being delivered community-based-- not on a regular school campus in a community we reside an hour away from.
I am also a mother of 2 children under the age of 5, and expecting a 3rd child in early June.
